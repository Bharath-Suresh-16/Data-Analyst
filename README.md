# Revenue Profit Insights

### Project overview:

This project features a Power BI dashboard designed to provide an in-depth analysis of revenue and profit data. The dashboard offers interactive visualizations, key performance indicators, and customizable filters, enabling users to explore financial trends and gain actionable insights. It serves as a powerful tool for stakeholders to monitor business performance and make data-driven decisions.




### Data sources:

SALES DATA: The data for this Power BI dashboard is sourced from four CSV files containing sales data for four years, from 2016 to 2019.



### Tools:

- Power BI: Used for creating and designing the interactive dashboard.
- Power Query: Utilized for cleaning and transforming the data to ensure accuracy and consistency in the analysis.
- SQL: Employed for data analysis to extract, manipulate, and analyze data efficiently.

### Data cleaning/preparation:

1. Combining Files: The data from the four CSV files was combined using Power Query to create a unified dataset for analysis.
2. Handling Missing Values and Outliers: Missing values and outliers were addressed through appropriate techniques to maintain data integrity.
3. Standardizing Data Formats: Data formats were standardized to ensure consistency across the dataset.
4. Creating Calculated Columns and Measures: Calculated columns and measures were created to facilitate analytical insights and visualization.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

1. What are the overall trends in revenue and profit over the four-year period from 2016 to 2019? Are there any noticeable patterns or fluctuations?
2. How does revenue and profit vary across different regions? Which regions contribute the most to overall sales, and are there any regions with notable growth or decline trends?
   
### Data analysis:

```sql
SELECT 
    SUM(totalprice - totalcost) AS total_profit
FROM 
    your_table_name;
    
```

The SQL code uses the SUM function to calculate the total profit across all transactions in your dataset. It subtracts the total cost from the total revenue for each transaction and then sums up these differences to give you the overall total profit.

In the context of your project, this SQL code snippet helps in performing financial analysis by providing insights into the total profit generated from sales transactions. It's a fundamental metric for understanding the financial health and performance of your business over the specified period.

```sql
SELECT 
    YEAR(date) AS year,
    SUM(totalprice) AS total_revenue,
    SUM(totalprofit) AS total_profit
FROM 
    Sales_data
GROUP BY 
    YEAR(sale_date)
ORDER BY 
    YEAR(sale_date);
```
This query calculates the total revenue and total profit for each year based on the sale_date column in your dataset.

###  Results :

1. Over the four years from 2016 to 2019:
- Revenue increased steadily from 11 million in 2016 to 28 million in 2017, then decreased and continued to grow to 13 million in 2019.
- Profit followed a similar trend, rising from 8.5 million in 2016 to 22 million in 2017, and then decreased further to 9.8 million in 2019.

2. Europe contributed the most to revenue and profit, with totals of 35 million and 28.1 million, respectively.
USA followed behind with revenue of 13.5 million and profit of 10.8 million.
